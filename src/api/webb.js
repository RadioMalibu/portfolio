For Monty it was also important that the site would have an Aftican character to represent her roots, and that it would be easy for her to keep up the site herself. To achieve this I adapted a WordPress theme and included a online shop.",

He has a larger than life personality and expresses this in this art. Different was therefore the goal of this site where a regular layout would not fit, though without loosing sight of the website's functionality. The red ribbon symbolises how art alway has been and always will be Mario's biggest passion; the common thread in his life.",
